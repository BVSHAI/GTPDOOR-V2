# GTPDOOR-V2
GTPDOOR V2 Backdoor Mechanism Implementation In Python

### Assumptions for decrytion mechanism

It's assuming that GTPDOOR v2 backdoor is gathering specific count of malformed packets, performing decryption based on known decryption mechanism (see doubleagent post) and performing another decryption/conversion for hex to ascii payload. There could be N ways to perform decryption and stuff.. afterall it's just a listener malware mechanis :)
